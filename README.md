====================
I have created this Repository to submit my first assignment for the course. The assignment is to create a guessing game.

My guessing game will be to have the user guess how many Major League Baseball teams there are today. If they guess it correctly, they will receive a notification congratulating them of this. If they guess low number, they will get an alert telling them they are almost there and to refresh the page to try again. Finally, if they guess higher than the actual number they will be alerted of this and will also get prompted to refresh the page and try again.
